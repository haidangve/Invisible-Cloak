# Invisibility Cloak Web App

## Project Description

This is a single-user web application that creates a real-time "invisibility cloak" effect using computer vision. Inspired by the magic from Harry Potter, this project uses Python, Flask, and OpenCV to capture a video stream from a webcam, replace a chosen cloak color with a pre-recorded background, and stream the composite video back to the user's browser. The application includes a simple, interactive frontend that allows the user to select the color of their cloak by clicking on it.

## Features

- **Real-time Invisibility:** Creates a live video stream where a selected color appears transparent, revealing a captured background.
- **Interactive Color Picker:** A web interface allows the user to click on their cloak to dynamically set the color to be made "invisible."
- **Simple Setup:** Designed for easy local deployment using a Flask web server.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python
- **Web Server:** Flask
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
- **Numerical Operations:** NumPy
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a clean, modular structure for clarity and maintainability.
